# Naming schemes

The following shortcuts are used in this section to denote naming schemes:

* CamelCased: The name starts with a capital letter, and has a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores.
* camelCased: Like CamelCase, but with a lower-case first letter
* snake_case: The name uses only lower-case letters, with words separated by underscores. 
* ALLCAPITALS: All capital letters.

## Bracket Style
One line conditional statements don't need any brackets
Opening brackets are broken from namespaces, classes, and function definitions. Brackets are attached to everything else including statements within a function, arrays, structs, and enums.   
```
int Foo(bool isBar)
{
    if (isFoo)
    {
        bar();
        return 1;
    }
    else if (isBar) { // Bad
        bar();
        return 2;
    }
    else
        return 0; // Good

    if (error)
    {
        return -1; // Ok
    }
}
```

The opening brace goes on the start of the next line as the start of the statement. If the closing brace is followed by another keyword, the other keyword go to the next line.  

Note: function implementations and class declarations always have the left brace on the start of a line.  

## Files  
Every source file should have an associated header file.  
Prefer .h and .cpp extentions for C++ files.  

## Header files  
A header should have header guards and include all other headers it needs.  
Use "#pragma once" instead of "#ifdef" guard.

## Forward declarations  
Avoid using forward declarations where possible.  
A "forward declaration" is a declaration of a class, function, or template without an associated definition.  

## Inline Functions  
Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 10 lines or fewer.  
A member function defined in a class definition is implicitly inline, but prefer force inline functions where appropriate (useful for testing program with different optimisation flags).

## Order of Includes  
All of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the project's source directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts . (the current directory) or .. (the parent directory). Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Separate the categories with empty lines.

Order of Includes (Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically):  
* Precompiled header file or project headers neccecary for containing compile unit. For example, for file "fooserver.cpp" it may be "fooserver.h". 
* C system files.  
* C++ system files.  
* Other libraries' .h files.  
* Your project's .h files.  

Example:  
```
#include "PrecompiledHeader.h" // Precompiled header files

#include "MainProjectClass.h" // Project headers neccecary for containing compile unit MainProjectClass.cpp

#include <math.h> // C system files
#include <stdarg.h>

#include <chrono> // C++ system files
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>

#include <lib/AlphaHeader> // lib`s libraries' .h files. 
#include <lib/BettaHeader> 

#include <qt/qbutton.h> // qt`s libraries' .h files.  
#include <qt/qtextfield.h>

#include "ProjectHeaderUseful.h" // Project's .h files.  
#include "ProjectHeaderUtils.h"
```

The first header included should be the header related to this source file, thus in position 1. This way you make sure that it includes anything it needs and that there is no "hidden" dependency: if there is, it'll be exposed right away and prevent compilation.  

The order you list your includes shouldn't matter from a technical point of view. If you designed it right, you should be able to put them in any order you want and it will still work.  

## Namespaces  
With few exceptions, place code in a namespace.  
Never use "using namespace" in Header Files.  
Always use "std::", never use "using namespace std;".
Do not use using-directives (e.g. using namespace foo). Do not use inline namespaces.  
Namespaces should have unique names based on the project name, and possibly its path.   
Unnamed namespaces are allowed.  
Dont use indentations for namespaces, except for unnamed namespaces.  
Place "{" at the next line of the namespace name.  
Prefer :: prefix (refers to the global namespace).  

```
#pragma once

#include "Era.h"

namespace pg
{
namespace window
{
    namespace
    {
        static constexpr NEWCONSTANT = 5;

        // ...
    }

	  using namespace ::pg::window;
	
	  // ...
	
} //namespace pg::window
} //namespace pg

```

## Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions  
Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global functions rarely.   

## Global variables
Global variables should almost never be used (see below for more on this). When they are used, global variables are with a leading g_ added.

```
int g_Shutdown; // Good: Really need this global variable
const bool gcb_Loaded; 
```

## Local Variables  
Initialize variables in the declaration.  

```
void f()
{
    int i;
    i = f();      // Bad
    int j = g();  // Good
    vector<int> v = {1, 2};  // Good
}
```

Put variable declaration before loop.  

```
// Inefficient implementation:
for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
{
    Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.
    f.DoSomething(i);
}

// It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a loop outside that loop:
Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
{
    f.DoSomething(i);
}
```

## Static and Global Variables  
If you need a static or global variable of a class type, consider initializing a raw pointer (not a "smart" pointer) which will never be freed.  
Objects with static storage duration, including global variables, static variables, static class member variables, and function static variables, must be [Plain Old Data](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/PODType) (POD): only ints, chars, floats, or pointers, or arrays/structs of POD.  

In C++11 the idea of a POD is to capture basically two distinct properties:  
* It supports static initialization  
* Compiling a POD in C++ gives you the same memory layout as a struct compiled in C.  

You can check if class isPOD with "[std::is_pod](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/type_traits/is_pod/)".
```
A POD struct is a non-union class that is both a trivial class and a standard-layout class, and has no non-static data members of type non-POD struct, non-POD union (or array of such types). Similarly, a POD union is a union that is both a trivial class and a standard layout class, and has no non-static data members of type non-POD struct, non-POD union (or array of such types). A POD class is a class that is either a POD struct or a POD union.
```

## Implicit Conversions  
Define as little as implicit conversions as possible. Use the explicit keyword for conversion operators and single-argument constructors.  
```
class Foo 
{
    explicit Foo(int x, double y); // Good
    // ...
};

void Func(Foo f);
Func({42, 3.14});  // Error, as expected
```

One-argument constructors that are not copy or move constructors should generally be marked explicit.  

## Structs vs. Classes  
Use a struct only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a class.  

## Class const methods
Always make class methods ‘const’ when they do not modify any class variables.

## Declaration Order  
Use the specified order of declarations within a class: "public:" before private:, methods before data members (variables), etc.  
place constructors and assignment operators before other methods.  

* Using-declarations
* list of friend classes
* Typedefs and Enums  
* public class methods  
* protected class methods  
* private class methods  
* public class variables  
* protected class variables  
* private class variables  

## Parameter Ordering  
When defining a function, parameter order is: 
* inputs 
* parameters that are both input and output
* outputs 

Dont use function arguments as both input and optput. Prefer separate varibale for function output and separate varibale for function input.
Always use const for parameters that dont change inside function.

## Write Short Functions  
Prefer small and focused functions.  

## Dont write comments for obvious things
* Do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the completely obvious. Notice below that it is not necessary to say "returns false otherwise" because this is implied.
```
// Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.
bool IsTableFull();
```
* When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that the person reading your code knows what constructors and destructors are for, so comments that just say something like "destroys this object" are not useful. 
* Comments should be descriptive ("Opens the file") rather than imperative ("Open the file");
* Do not duplicate comments in both the .h and the .cc. Duplicated comments diverge.
* Tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments before them.
* Avoid comments where a better function/variable name would be better

```
/** This function returns the sum of two integers */
void function(int a, int b) // Bad
{
    // Add the two parameters a and b
    return a + b;
}

void sum(int a, int b) // Good
{
    return a + b;
} // Notice the lack of comments above due to better naming
```

## Use newline for logical separation
Note: You can use tools like clang-format for automatic formatting.

Prefer code with newline between logical blocks:
Good:
```
    GLuint vertexShader;
    GLuint fragmentShader;
    GLint linked = GL_FALSE; // Ok, variables separated from functions that use them
    
    vertexShader = LoadShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, vShaderStr);
    fragmentShader = LoadShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, fShaderStr);
```
Appropriate:
```
    GLuint vertexShader;
    GLuint fragmentShader;
    GLint linked = GL_FALSE; // Still ok, but may be better
    vertexShader = LoadShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, vShaderStr);
    fragmentShader = LoadShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, fShaderStr);
```
Bad, total chaos:
```
    GLuint vertexShader;
    
    GLuint fragmentShader;
    
    GLint linked = GL_FALSE;
    vertexShader = LoadShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER, vShaderStr);
    
    fragmentShader = LoadShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, fShaderStr);
```
## Make nice columns
Indent the names of class variables and class methods to make nice columns. The variable type or method return type is in the first column and the variable name or method name is in the second column.
```
class ExampleClass {
    public:
        float		    getLength(void) const;
        const float *	toFloatPtr(void) const;
    
    public: // Good: Padding inside struct/class
        float x;
        float y;
        float z;
}
```
The * of the pointer is in the first column because it improves readability when considered part of the type.

Align assignment to make nice columns where possible.

Nice:
```
foo  = "abc";
bar1 = "defDEF";
baz  = "ghi";
baz1 = "jklm";

yourveryverylongvariablenamemaybehere = "bdam"; // Notice newline separation
```
Ok, but above ↑ is better:
```
foo = "abc";
bar1 = "defDEF";
baz = "ghi";
baz1 = "jklm";
```

Bad:
```
a = array([[1,0, 0], // Forgotten spaces, needs padding [ 1, 0, 0] e.t.c.
           [0,32,0],
           [0,0, 1]])
a = array([[1,0, 0],[0,32,0],[0,0, 1]])
```
Good:
```
a = array([[ 1, 0,     0 ], // Notice padding
           [ 0, 31232, 0 ],
           [ 0, 0,     1 ]]);
```

But dont align operators or arguments:
```
abcd = hello(34, 12) +   fgh( 2,  3); // Bad
foo  =  boop( 1,  5) + thing(12, 19); // Bad
fun(123456, 7,  89,    0) // Bad
fun(    12, 3, 456, 7890) // Bad
matrix(1, 0,
       0, 1); // Bad, pass array/container for matrix as argument
matrix([1, 0,
        0, 1]); // Good
```

## Reference Arguments  
When using reference as parameters prefer using them as const.  
Use reference as in/out parameters only if the argument is a mandatory input (So the ref cannot be null).
```
void Foo(const string &in, string *out);
```

An out argument of a function should be passed by reference except rare cases where it is optional in which case it should be passed by pointer.  
```
void MyClass::getSomeValue(OutArgumentType& outArgument) const // Good doSomething(OutArgumentType* outArgument) // Avoid as much as possible
```

## DELETE and RELEASE (macro or functions)  
Prefer the following:  
SafeDelete should be used for memory allocated with new  
SafeRelease should be called for com objects (like directx objects) and "under the hood" is doind something like this  

```
inline template<class T  void SafeDelete(T*& p)
{
    if (p != nullptr) 

        delete p;
        p = nullptr;
    }
}

inline template<class T> void SafeDeleteArray(T*& p)
{
    if (p != nullptr)
    {
        delete[] p;
        p = nullptr;
    }
}

inline template<class T> void SafeRelease(T*& p)
{
    if (p)
    {
        p->Release();
        p = nullptr;
    }
}
```
They compile down to EXACTLY the same code in the end as macro.  

Macro are also allowed, but be very cautious with macros.   
Prefer inline functions, enums, and const variables to macros.  

Instead of  
```
#define SAFE_RELEASE(p) { if ( (p) ) { (p)->Release(); (p) = nullptr; } }
#define SAFE_DELETE(a) { if ( (a) != nullptr ) delete (a); (a) = nullptr; }
```
use inline templates.  

Also remember that ISO C++ specifies, that delete on a NULL pointer just doesn't do anything.  

# Macro  
Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a const variable.  
Instead of using a macro to "abbreviate" a long variable name, use a reference.  

## 0 and nullptr or NULL  
Use 0 for integers, 0.0 for reals, nullptr for pointers, and '\0' for chars.  
Avoid using NULL.  

Also remember about expressions and floating point types:
```
float x = 1 / 2; // Equals 0
float x = 1 / 2.0f; // Equals 0.5
```

## Use precision specification for floating point values unless there is an explicit need for a double.
```
// Good:
float f = 0.5f;
float g = 1.0f;
double k = 0.1;
// Bad:
float f = 0.5;
float g = 1.f;
double k = 0.;
```

## auto  
"auto" is permitted, when it increases readability, particularly as described below. Do not use auto for file-scope or namespace-scope variables, or for class members.  
Never initialize an auto-typed variable with a braced initializer list.  
Programmers have to understand the difference between auto and const auto& or they'll get copies when they didn't mean to.  

## Braced Initializer List  
Never assign a braced-init-list to an auto local variable. In the single element case, what this means can be confusing.  
```
auto d = {1.23};        // d is a std::initializer_list<double>
auto d = double{1.23};  // Good -- d is a double, not a std::initializer_list.
```

## Threads  
Emscripten dont like them, use 
```
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__ 
// thread code with browser support
#else
// thread code 
#endif
```
to create threads.  

## Smart pointers  
Smart pointers are allowed.  

## RTTI  
Avoid using Run Time Type Information (RTTI): dynamic_cast, typeid.  

## Tests  
Use CppUnit, Google Test or any other  [testing frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks).  
Unit tests and performance tests should be placed in the same directory as the functionality they're testing.  
Use compile autotests to see whether a C++ feature is supported by all compilers in the test farm.
Dont forget to write regretion tests.

## Casting  
Use C++-style casts like static_cast<float>(double_value) or brace initialization for conversion of arithmetic types like int64 y = int64{1} << 42. Do not use cast formats like int y = (int)x or int y = int(x) (but the latter is okay when invoking a constructor of a class type).  

```
	float x = 2.2;
	double y = double{ x }; // Ok
	float z = float{ y }; // Ok, but error: conversion from 'type_1' to 'type_2' requires a narrowing conversion
    int e = float(y); // Bad
    int f = (float)(y); // Bad, but can be used if interfacing with C
	int g = static_cast<int>(y); // Good
```

The problem with C casts is the ambiguity of the operation. Do not use cast formats like int y = (int)x or int y = int(x).  

* Use brace initialization to convert arithmetic types (e.g. int64{x}). This is the safest approach because code will not compile if conversion can result in information loss. The syntax is also concise.  
* Use static_cast as the equivalent of a C-style cast that does value conversion, when you need to explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass, or when you need to explicitly cast a pointer from a superclass to a subclass. In this last case, you must be sure your object is actually an instance of the subclass.  
* Use "const_cast" to remove the const qualifier (see const) only if its really necessary. Avoid use of "const_cast". When object is needed to be modified, but only const versions are accessible, create a function that clearly gives an editable version of the object.
* Use reinterpret_cast to do unsafe conversions of pointer types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if you know what you are doing and you understand the aliasing issues.  
* Prefer the brace initialisation to in initialise objects and values of unknown type in generic code;
```
template <typename T>
void func()
{
  T value = T{};
}
```

## Preincrement and Predecrement  
Use preincrementation (++i) whenever possible. The semantics of postincrement (i++) include making a copy of the value being incremented, returning it, and then preincrementing the “work value”.   
Use prefix form (++i) of the increment and decrement operators with iterators and other template objects.  

## Use of const  
Use const whenever it makes sense.  
With C++11, constexpr is a better choice for some uses of const.   
Prefer enums to define constants over "static const int" or "define".  
Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the keyword const to indicate the variables are not changed (e.g., const int foo).   
Class functions can have the const qualifier to indicate the function does not change the state of the class member variables (e.g., class Foo { int Bar(char c) const; };).  
Prefer "const int* foo" to "int const *foo" (same result).   
In C++11, use constexpr to define true constants (fixed at compilation/link time) or to ensure constant initialization.  

```
// Good:
const int* p;		// pointer to const int
int* const p;		// const pointer to int
const int* const p;	// const pointer to const int
// Bad:
int const *p;           // Perfer "const int *p;"
```

## Integer Types  
If your variable represents a value that could ever be greater than or equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as int64 or size_t.
Don't use an unsigned type where possible (especially dont use unsigned type in loop).
Prefer using size_t anywhere you need an unsigned or a 64-bit type integer

template <typename Type, typename... Args>

```
Prefer writing the documentation on the prototype of the function or the class and don't clone the documentation on the declaration

## 64-bit Portability  
Code should be 64-bit and 32-bit friendly.   
Dont use printf() where possible.  

## Aliases  
Prefer "using" over "typedef". The using syntax has an advantage when used within templates.  
When defining a public alias, document the intent of the new name, including whether it is guaranteed to always be the same as the type it's currently aliased to, or whether a more limited compatibility is intended.   
```
template <typename T> using my_type = whatever<T>;
```
Local convenience aliases are allowed in function definitions, private sections of classes, explicitly marked internal namespaces, and in .cc files.   

Use type aliases in classes where possible if its helps readability and maintainance:
```
class Student
{
public:
  typedef std::vector<Teacher*> Teachers; // Good
  const Teachers& getTeachers();
private:
  Teachers m_teachers;
};
```
The `typedef` makes it easier to read and makes future possible modifications to what is a collection of Teachers easier (for instance, changing `std::vector<>` to `std::list<>`)

## RAII
* RAII guarantees that the resource is available to any function that may access the object (resource availability is a class invariant). 
* RAII guarantees that all resources are released when the lifetime of their controlling objectends, in reverse order of acquisition. 
* Never use malloc and free. Use C++'s "new" operator or smart pointers.

# Inlining  
Use inline keyword (The inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization, by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units, but using the keyword doesn't mean the compiler has to inline the function, and not using the keyword doesn't forbid the compiler from inlining the function).  
Stop inlining virtual methods: You can't inline virtual methods under most circumstances.
Stop inlining constructors and destructors: Constructors and destructors are often significantly more complex than you think they are, especially if your class has any non-POD data members.

Inline functions must be in a .h file. If your inline functions are very short, they should go directly into your .h file (Inline functions are declared in the header because, in order to inline a function call, the compiler must be able to see the function body. For a naive compiler to do that, the function body must be in the same translation unit as the call.).  

Functions declared in the header must be marked inline because otherwise, every translation unit which includes the header will contain a definition of the function.  

* Access functions are to be inline.  
* Forwarding functions are to be inline.  
* Constructors and destructors must *not* be inline.  
 
Move Inline Method Bodies Out of Class Definitions. Instead of inlining method bodies in a class definition, instead declare the method regularly and define it in the header file below the class definition with an inline specifier:

```
class foo
{
public:
 void bar();
};

inline void foo::bar()
{
 /* do something */
}
```

## Naming variables  
Use lowerCamelCase for variable names.  
Use lowerCamelCase_UpperCamelCase for variable names containing "_".

Avoid short or meaningless names (e.g. "a", "rbarr", "nughdeget") and making abbreviations.  
Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious.  

```
int integralValue;

// private class members:
Timepoint m_startMark;
bool m_bPaused;
const bool m_cbDebug;

// Useful Flag
bool a; // Bad, prefer to use:
bool importantFlag; // Good

int i = 0; // Ok, the var is clearly a counter variable
for (int i = 0; i < nbValues; ++i)
{
}
```

## Type Names  
Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores: MyExcitingClass, MyExcitingEnum.  

```
struct MyExcitingStruct {}; // Good
struct myBadStruct {}; // Bad
sturct my_new_struct {}; // Bad
```

## File and directory names  
Use lowercase for source file names and directory names.  

## Useful class names

For "Writer" class with <name> use as:
<name>Writer

```
class Tool; // Bad: Doesn't describe anything. A tool which does what?
class AbstractTool; // Good
class ToolInterface; // Good
class DebugTool; // Good
```

Prefer class naming convention:
* Abstract // (prefix) Class with virtual methods that can be overridden, and some code, but at least one pure virtual method that makes the class not instantiable
* Interface // (suffix) Class with only pure virtual methods (i.e. without any code)
* Writer
* Reader
* Handler
* Helper
* Container
* Protocol
* Controller
* Converter
* View
* Factory
* Entity
* Attribute
* Provider
* Service
* Element
* Manager
* Node
* Option
* Context
* Item
* Base
* System
* Entity
* Component

```
class ToolInterface
{
public:
    // Empty virtual destructor for proper cleanup
    virtual ~ToolInterface() {}

    virtual void Method1() = 0;
    virtual void Method2() = 0;
};


class AbstractTool
{
public:
    virtual ~AbstractTool();

    virtual void Method1();
    virtual void Method2();
    void Method3();

    virtual void Method4() = 0; // make not instantiable
};
```

## Inheritance

Prefer composition over inheritance as it is more malleable / easy to modify later, but do not use a compose-always approach. 
When using inheritance, make it public.

Inheritance:
```
// The Manager object is inherited from Employee and Person.
class Manager : public Person, public Employee 
{ 
   ...
}
```
Composition:
```
Class Manager // The Manager object is composed as an Employee and a Person. 
{ 
   private m_Title;
   private m_Employee;
   ...
   public Manager(Person p, Employee e)
   {
      m_Title = e.Title;
      m_Employee = e;
      ...
   }
}
```

Use multiple inheritance only when at most one of the base classes has an implementation and all other base classes must be pure interface classes tagged with the Interface suffix.
Be careful about the diamond problem of inheritance

## Class Data Members  
Data members of classes, both static and non-static, are named like ordinary nonmember variables, but with a leading "m_".  
```
	private:
		/** The timepoint stored when the timer was paused last time */
		timepoint m_PausedMark;

		/**  Is timer running */
		bool m_Running;

		/** Is timer paused */
		bool m_Paused;
```

## Function Names  
Use lowerCamelCase   

```
    /** Set duration elapsed when the timer was running and not paused **/
    void setTotalRunning(const Duration& duration);
```

One of the reasons for this is the range-based for-loop (since C++11). If you want to make your class work with the range-for, you have to define functions called begin and end for that class. The names must be exactly begin and end, so e.g. Begin and End are not supported.   

Function declaration order should match function definition order.

Use the override specifier on all derived from a base class overriding functions.

You may use final keyword when overriding the virtual method and requiring that no further subclasses can override it.

Dont annotate a method with more than one of the virtual, override, or final keywords.

## Namespace Names  
Namespace names are all lowerCamelCase. Prefer lowercase namespaces by creting inner namespaces instead of longLowerCamelCaseNamespace.

```
namespace chronics; // Good
namespace fastElectronics; // Good
namespace pgTiming; // Bad, may split into "pg" and "timing".

namespace pg // Good
{ 
namespace timing
{
    /* ... */
}
}
```

# Macro Names  
Macro should be named with all capitals letters.  

# Enumerator Names  
Enumerators (for both scoped and unscoped enums) should be named like Classes (Camel Case).
Expression inside enums should also be named with all capitalized letters.
```
enum AlternateUrlTableErrors
{
  OK = 0,
  OUTOFMEMORY = 1,
  MALFORMEDINPUT = 2,
};
```
Prefix is not allowed, and prefer the use of enum class wherever it is possible:  
Expression inside enums class should also be named like classes.
```
// Ok, use as Color::RED e.t.c.
enum Color
{
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
};
// Good, use as Color::Red
enum class Color
{
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
};
// Bad
enum Color
{
  COLOR_RED,
  COLOR_GREEN,
  COLOR_BLUE
};
// Bad
enum class Color
{
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE
};
```

## Comment Style  
Use either the ```//, /** */ or /* */``` syntax, as long as you are consistent.
Code that is not used (commented out) and not part of an explanation shall be deleted.
Always put a space after the comment opener and begin the comment with an uppercase letter
```
/** New Comment */ // Good
/**New Comment */ // Bad

/**
 * Multiline comment
 * You can put comment here 
 * this line doesn't need to start with an uppercase letter as it is
 * the continuation of the precedent line
 */
```  

## Output arguments
Output arguments to methods / functions (i.e., variables that the function can modify) are better passed by pointer, not by reference. E.g.:
```
int exampleMethod(FooThing input, BarThing* output);
```

## Deprecation code
You can use [[deprecated]] on separate line:

```
[[deprecated]]
void foo()
{
    // ...
}
```

## ToDo code
Use doxygen @todo comment style.

## Tabulation  
Use 4 spaces for tabulation.  
Set editor settings to use 4 spaces. Instructions for VS2015 [Options, Text Editor, All Languages, Tabs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7sffa753.aspx).  
No whitespace at the end of a line.

In all cases, prefer spaces to tabs in source files. People have different preferred indentation levels, and different styles of indentation that they like; this is fine. What isn’t fine is that different editors/viewers expand tabs out to different tab stops. This can cause your code to look completely unreadable, and it is not worth dealing with.

## Line Length
Each line of text in your code should be at most 200 characters long.    

## Classes  
Never specify public non const member data in a class.   
Use getters and setters 
```
class BadClass
{
public:
    int m_nbRead; // Bad
};

// Good
class GoodClass
{
public:
    /** Get the number of read */
    int getNbRead() { return m_nbRead; }

    /** Set the number of read */
    void setNbRead(int nbRead) { m_nbRead = nbRead; }

private:
    /** Number of read of this class */
    int m_nbRead;
}
```

## Use compute, find, initialize in function names  
If function just calculates/changes something, then prefer compute as part of function name.  
```
void computeDuration();
valueSet->computeAverage();
matrix->computeInverse()
```
If function just finds something, then prefer find as part of function name.  
```
vertex.findNearestVertex();
matrix.findMinElement();
```
If function just initializes something, then prefer init or initialize as part of function name.  
```
engine.init();
```

## Conditionals  
* No spaces between condition and parenthesis  
* If and else keywords belong on separate lines  
* Proper space after if and first parenthesis.   
* Always prefer braces

```
if (condition) // Good - proper space between IF and ( 
{
}
else
{ 
}
```
```
// Good:
if (x)
{
}
x = (y * 0.5f + (y * 0.5f));
// Bad:
if ( x ) {
}
x = ( y * 0.5f + (y * 0.5f) ); // Note padding for inner parentheses
```

## Loops and Switch Statements  
* Proper space after Loop/Switch and first parenthesis   
* Don’t use default labels in fully covered switches over enumerations.
* Not fully covered switch statements should always have a default case.  If the default case should never execute, simply assert or throw:
* A case of a switch statement should not be indented  
```
switch (var) // Good
{
case 0:
{
    /* ... */
    break;
}
case 1:
{
    /* ... */
    // Fall through (in case there is no break !)
}
case 2:
{
    /* ... */
    break;
}
default: 
{
    assert(false);
    break;
}
}

switch (var) // Bad
{
    case 0:
    {
        /* ... */
        break;
    }
    default: 
    {
        assert(false);
        break;
    }
}
```
Every case must have a break (or return) statement at the end or a comment to indicate that there's intentionally no break, unless another case follows immediately.  

* Always prefer braces  

Prefer
```
while (condition);
```
over
```
while (condition) continue;
```

Prefer no spaces inside parentheses in loops.  
```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{}
for (auto x : counts)
{}
```

## Pointer and Reference Expressions  
Use space preceding:  
```
x = *p;
p = &x;
x = r.y;
x = r->y;
char *c;
const string &str;
```
Always define pointer variables on new line:  
```
int *pp, *pt; // Bad (and worse is int *pp, pt)
```
Good:  
```
int *pp; 
int *pt;
```

## Boolean Expressions  
When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the standard line length, be consistent in how you break up the lines.  
End operators at the ending of the lines. Commas go at the end of wrapped lines.
Prefer the use of `and`, `or` and `not` instead of `&&`, `||` and `!` respectivly.
```
if (thisOneThing > thisOtherThing and
    aThirdThing == aFourthThing and
    notYetAnother and
    lastOne)
{
  /* ... */
}
```

Prefer operators before statemant inside condition:
```
// Bad: use of "&&" at the beginning, hard to read.
if (thisOneThing > thisOtherThing
    && aThirdThing == aFourthThing
    && notYetAnother
    && lastOne == "itsString")
{
    call_function(a, b, c);
}

// Good: use of "and" at the end
if (thisOneThing > thisOtherThing and
    aThirdThing == aFourthThing and
    notYetAnother and
    lastOne == "itsString")
{
    call_function(a, b, c);
}

// Best: condition splited to meaningful "const bool" variables. 
const bool oneBiggerOther = thisOneThing > thisOtherThing;
const bool thirdEqualsFourth = aThirdThing == aFourthThing;
const bool lastEqualsItsString = lastOne == "itsString";

// Also use "not yetAnother" instead of "notYetAnother".
const bool oneThirdAnother = oneBiggerOther and thirdEqualsFourth && not yetAnother;

const bool isCallAvailable = oneThirdAnother && lastEqualsItsString;

if (isCallAvailable)
{
    call_function(a, b, c);
}
```

## Return Values  
Use parentheses in "return expr;" only where you would use them in `x = expr;`.  
```
// Good:
return (some_long_condition and
        another_condition);
return (now() - m_StartMark);
return defaultDuration;

// Bad:
return (defaultDuration);
```

Avoid use else after return. So use:
```
if (foo)
{
    return 1;
}

return 2;
```
instead of:
```
if (foo)
{
    return 1;
}
else
{
    return 2;
}
```
## Preprocessor Directives  
The hash mark that starts a preprocessor directive should always be at the beginning of the line. Even when preprocessor directives are within the body of indented code, the directives should start at the beginning of the line!  
```
// Good - directives at beginning of line
    if (lopsided_score)
    {
#if THATISNICE      // Correct -- Starts at beginning of line
        DropEverything();
#endif
        BackToNormal();
    }
// Bad - indented directives
    if (lopsided_score)
    {
        #if DISASTER_PENDING  // Wrong!  The "#if" should be at beginning of line
        DropEverything();
        #endif                // Wrong!  Do not indent "#endif"
        BackToNormal();
    }
```
Always check whether a preprocessor variable is defined before probing its value
```
#if Foo == 0  // Bad
#if defined(Foo) && (Foo == 0) // Good
```

## Class Format  
* Any base class name should be on the same line as the subclass name.  
* The public:, protected:, and private: keywords should not be indented compared to the class.  
* Except for the first instance, these keywords should be preceded by a blank line. This rule is optional in small classes.  
* Do not leave a blank line after these keywords.  
* The public section should be first, followed by the protected and finally the private section (methods first, then members, see Declaration Order).
* For better readability, those keywords can be reuse to separate declarations (public methods then public members, etc...), when use in this way, comment the use of the keyword (// Public interface, // Private members, etc...).

```
    class ChronoTimer : public ATimer<ticks>
    {
    // Public constructors
    public:
        ChronoTimer();

        ~ChronoTimer();

    // Public interface
    public:
        /** Start timer execution **/
        void start() override;

    // Protected interface
    protected:
        /** Recalculate timer durations and states */
        void update();

    // Private methods
    private:
        /** Helper use to compute the running time */
        void incrementTime();

    // Public members
    private:
        /** The duration elapsed when the timer was running and not paused */
        duration m_TotalRunning;
    };
```

## Constructor Initializer Lists  
Prefer constructor initializer lists be all on one line when everything fits on one line.  When the list spans multiple lines, put each member on its own line and align them:  
```
// When everything fits on one line:
MyClass::MyClass(int var) : m_someVar(var)
{
    doSomething();
}

// When the list spans multiple lines, put each member on its own line and align them:
MyClass::MyClass(int var) :
    m_someVar(var),        // 4 space indent
    m_otherVar(var + 1)    // lined up
{  
  doSomething();
}

```

## Namespace Formatting  
The contents of namespaces are not indented.  
Named namespaces do not add an extra level of indentation.
At the closing bracket of a named namespace, comment the name of the closed namespace
Unnamed namespaces add an extra level of indentation.
```
namespace foo
{
namespace bar
{
    namespace
    {
    }
} // namespace foo
} // namespace bar
```

## Anonymous Namespaces
Use anonymous namespaces for constant declarations, helper functions and helper structs/classes

Anonymous namespaces are a great language feature that tells the C++ compiler that the contents of the namespace are only visible within the current translation unit, allowing more aggressive optimization and eliminating the possibility of symbol name collisions. 

Good:
```
namespace
{
    /** Constant */
    static constexpr const char * const DOM = "constant";

    /** Helper class */
    class StringSort
    {
    /* ... */
    public:
        StringSort(...);
        bool operator<(const char *RHS) const;
    };

    /** Helper function */
    void runHelper()
    {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```
## Operators  
```
// Assignment operators always have spaces around them.
x = 0;
// No spaces separating unary operators and their arguments.
x = -5;
++x;
// Other binary operators usually have spaces around them
v = w * x + y / z;
// Inner parentheses should have no internal padding.
v = (w * (x + z));   // Good
v = ( w * (x + z) ); // Bad
v = (w * ( x + z )); // Bad
g = (v + ((x + (x + z)) + z)); // Good
```

## Templates  
UpperCamelCase (no underscore separation) for template arguments.  
Place "template" on separate line.  
Use padding after "template" (before "<>").  
Use the brace initialisation to in initialise objects and values of unknown type in generic code;
```
template <typename T>
void func()
{
    T value = T{};
}
```
Prefer "typename" instead of "class" (the difference is "nothing") [where possible](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11311432).  

```
template <typename T>     // Good: Padding after "template"; T is UpperCamelCase; "typename" used instead of "class".
class CompressionUtil     // Good: Class name is UpperCamelCase and meaningful.
{                         // Good: "{" on new line.
...
};
```

## Casts  
```
// No spaces inside the angle brackets
vector<string> x;
y = static_cast<char*>(x);
// Spaces between type and pointer are OK, but be consistent.
vector<char *> x;
set<list<string>> x;        // Permitted in C++11 code.
```

Avoid C-style casts when possible:
```
// Wrong
char* blockOfMemory = (char* ) malloc(data.size());
 
// Correct
char *blockOfMemory = reinterpret_cast<char *>(malloc(data.size()));
```

## Windows and Visual Studio  
* Keep as close as you can to the underlying C++ types. For example, use "const TCHAR *" instead of "LPCTSTR".  
* When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the compiler to warning level 3 or higher, and treat all warnings as errors.  
* "#pragma once" is pretty widely [supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragma_once#Portability), you can use it.  

## Abbreviations  
Abbreviations must use lowerCamelCase (in the start of variable name) or UpperCamelCase (in the middle of variable name).  
```
exportHtmlSource(); // Bad
exportHTMLSource(); // Good 
openDvdPlayer();    // Bad
openDVDPlayer();    // Good  
dvdReader();        // Good
```
## Global variables  
Prefer :: prefix for global variables (refers to the global namespace).  
```
::mainWindow.open()
::applicationContext.getName()  
```
## Types to use
* Do not use unsigned types to mean “this value should never be < 0”. For that, use assertions or run-time checks (as appropriate).
* Use size_t for object and allocation sizes, object counts, array and pointer offsets, vector indices, and so on. The signed types are incorrect and unsafe for these purposes (e.g. integer overflow behavior for signed types is undefined in the C and C++ standards, while the behavior is defined for unsigned types.) The C++ STL is a guide here: they use size_t and foo::size_type for very good reasons.
* Use size_t directly in preference to std::string::size_type and similar.
* In cases where the exact size of the type matters (e.g. a 32-bit pixel value, a bitmask, or a counter that has to be a particular width), use one of the sized types.

## Type name  
Prefer UpperCamelCase type names.  
```
struct Foo {};
class Bar {};
```

## Paramater name  
Prefer lowerCamelCase for paramater name based on its type.  
```
void setTopic(Topic* topic)  
void connect(Database* database)
```

## Use "nb, s and Id" in variable name where possible.  
```
vector<Point>  points;
int            values[];
```

```
nbPoints, nbLines
```

```
tableId, clientId
```

## Use  i, j, k... in loops where possible.  
```
for (int i = 0; i < nbTables); ++i)
{
}
```

## Prefer "is" in boolean function name  
```
    /** Is timer paused **/
    inline const bool isPaused() const
    { 
        return m_paused; 
    }
```
If "is" not appropriate use has/an/should e.t.c.  
```
bool hasLicense();
bool canEvaluate();
bool shouldSort();
```

## Prefer symmetric names  
* get/set   
* add/remove   
* create/destroy   
* start/stop   
* insert/delete  
* increment/decrement   
* old/new   
* begin/end  
* first/last   
* up/down   
* min/max  
* next/previous   
* old/new   
* open/close  
* show/hide   
* suspend/resume  
* e.t.c.  

## Prefer full names  
```
int maximumAverage = computeAverage() / currentAverage; // Good
// Dont use compAvg(), maxAvg or cntAvg
```
Those are acceptable abbreviations, the rest should be avoided.
cmd    <->    command  
cp     <->    copy  
init   <->    initialize  
max    <->    maximum
min    <->    minimum
ms     <->    milliseconds
ns     <->    nanoseconds
s      <->    seconds

Dont use that rule for abbrevations (html, cpu)  

## Dont use "p" or "ptr" prefix for pointers/parameters  
Line* line; // Dont use Line* pLine; or Line* linePtr;  

## Initialize variables  
* Prefer "char buffer[32] = {};" to "char buffer[32];"  
* Always initialize variables  
```
  char x, *y, z; // Bad
  char x = '\0', *y = nullptr, z = '\0'; // Good
```

## Language  
Use english language in source code. All code is ascii only (7-bit characters only). 

## Comparison and boolean check  
* Prefer if (something) to if (something == true) for boolean values.  
* Prefer if (something) to if (something != 0) for int values. 
* Prefer if (myPtr) to if (myPtr != nullptr).
* Prefer (foo == 0) to (0 == foo).
* Prefer comparison using epsilon for floating point types like:  
```
template<class T>
typename std::enable_if<not std::numeric_limits<T>::is_integer, bool>::type
almostEquals(T a, T b)
{
    if (not std::isfinite(a) or not std::isfinite(b)) return false;

    T maximum = std::max({T{1.0}, std::fabs(a), std::fabs(b)});
    return std::fabs(a - b) < std::numeric_limits<T>::epsilon() * maximum;
}
```
## Avoid "using namespace std;" e.t.c.  
Use "using" only where its neccesary.  

# Include Units in Names  
If a variable represents time, weight, or some other unit then include the unit in the name so developers can more easily spot problems. 
```
size_t timeElapsed;   // Bad  
size_t timeElapsedMs; // Good
```
## Avoid "magic numbers"  
Prefer constexpr or const variable to "magic number".  

## Floating point constants  
```
double total = 0.0;    // Bad:  double total = 0;  
double speed = 3.0e8;  // Bad:  double speed = 3e8;  
double total = 0.5;    // Bad:  double total = .5;
```
# Containers
Prefer 1D (one-dimensional approach) to 2D (two-dimensional approach) [for 2D array representation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17260533). For dense matrices the 1D approach is likely to be faster since it offers better memory locality and less allocation and deallocation overhead. Dynamic-1D consumes less memory than the 2D approach. The latter also requires more allocations.

Two-dimensional approach (Bad):
```
int **ary = new int*[sizeY];     // Bad
for(int i = 0; i < sizeY; ++i)   // Create
{
    ary[i] = new int[sizeX];
}

// May be used as ary[i][j]
for(int i = 0; i < sizeY; ++i)  // Cleanup
{
    delete[] ary[i];
}

delete[] ary;

// ... You could also declare array as:
auto array = new double[M][N](); // Bad
```
One-dimensional approach (Good):
```
int *ary = new int[sizeX*sizeY]; // Good
// May be used as ary[i*sizeY+j]
delete[] ary;
```
If you want to have a matrix class that's always, say, 4x4, prefer container [like std::array<float, 4*4>](http://cpp.sh/2tqe) or std::dynarray:
```
constexpr int sizeX = 4;
constexpr int sizeY = 4;

// Fill with identity matrix
std::array<float, 4*4> m_array{1, 0, 0, 0, 
                                0, 1, 0, 0, 
                                0, 0, 1, 0, 
                                0, 0, 0, 1};
                                
// Prints identity matrix
for(size_t i = 0; i < sizeX; ++i)
{
    for(size_t j = 0; j < sizeY; ++j)
    {
        std::cout << m_array.at(i*sizeY+j) <<  " ";
    }

    std::cout << "\n";
}
```
Don’t evaluate end() every time through a loop.
```
BasicBlock *BB = ...
for (BasicBlock::iterator I = BB->begin(); I != BB->end(); ++I) // Bad
{ 
    /* ... use I ... */
}
BasicBlock *BB = ...
for (BasicBlock::iterator I = BB->begin(), E = BB->end(); I != E; ++I) // Good, added E = BB->end()
{
    /* ... use I ... */
}
```

# Lambda
Format Lambdas Like Blocks Of Code, except that the first bracket shoud be on the same line as the lambda call itself:
```
std::sort(foo.begin(), foo.end(), [&](Foo a, Foo b) -> bool { // Good
  return a.bam < b.bam;
});

std::sort(foo.begin(), foo.end(), [&](Foo a, Foo b) -> bool // Bad
{
    return a.bam < b.bam;
}); 
```

Always write parentheses for the parameter list, even if the function does not take parameters.  

```
[]() { doSomething(); } // Good 
[] { doSomething(); }   // Bad
```

You have to explicitly specify the return type, if the lambda contains more than a single expression.

# Braced Initializer Lists
Act as-if the braces were parentheses in a function call.
```
foo({a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3});

llvm::Constant *Mask[] = {
    llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 0),
    llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 1),
    llvm::ConstantInt::get(llvm::Type::getInt32Ty(getLLVMContext()), 2)};
```

# Language and Compiler Issues
## Treat Compiler Warnings Like Errors.
Any Compiler warning that annoys you can be fixed by massaging the code appropriately:
```
if (V = getValue()) { // Bad: warning about == operator.
  ...
}
if ((V = getValue())) { // Dood: no warning
  ...
}
```
On Visual C++, I use /W4 and /WX (treat warnings as errors). VC also has /Wall. Use some [set of extra-paranoid flags](http://stackoverflow.com/a/401276).

* Write Portable Code
* Avoid RTTI or Exceptions
## Avoid Static Constructors.
Static constructors and destructors (e.g. global variables whose types have a constructor or destructor) should not be added to the code base:
 Order of initialization is undefined between globals in different source files.
["static initialization order fiasco"](http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/ctors.html#fqa-10.12)
As a rule of thumb, struct should be kept to structures where all members are declared public.
* Do not use Braced Initializer Lists to Call a Constructor
* #include as Little as Possible
* Use the “assert” macro from <cassert> to its fullest (assert is good for checking a case during run-time). Use static assert to make assertions at compile time.
```
inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I)
{
    assert(I < Operands.size() && "getOperand() out of range!"); // Good, prints message.
    return Operands[I];
}
```
Note: You should never depend on assert to do anything because the code can be compiled with NDEBUG defined and then assert does nothing. Production code is oftentimes compiled with NDEBUG defined to ensure that those assert statements disappear.
* Use #ifdef with platfom dependant code
It may be less efficient than evaluating it at the start of the loop. Also if you write the loop in the second form, it is immediately obvious without even looking at the body of the loop that the container isn’t being modified.
* Avoid #include <iostream> in a header, because many common implementations transparently inject a static constructor into every translation unit that includes it.
* Avoid std::endl because most of the time, you probably have no reason to flush the output stream, so it’s better to use a literal '\n'.
* Use UTF-8 file encodings.
* Avoid putting project’s header files into the [precompiled header file](http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/precompiledheaders.html). Put only headers that’ll not change in your precompiled headers – like windows.h, STL headers and header only implementations like rapid json..
* Use LF line endings: Unix-style linebreaks ('\n'), not Windows-style ('\r\n').

## Spacing around control flow
Spaces Before Parentheses in control flow statements, but not in normal function call expressions and function-like macros. 
```
if (X) ... // Good
if(X) ...  // Bad
for (I = 0; I != 100; ++I) ... // Good
for(I = 0; I != 100; ++I) ...  // Bad
while (condition) ... // Good
while(condition) ...  // Bad

somefunc(42);  // Good
somefunc (42); // Bad

assert(3 != 4 && "laws of math are failing me");  // Good
assert (3 != 4 && "laws of math are failing me"); // Bad

A = foo(42, 92) + bar(X);   // Good
A = foo (42, 92) + bar (X); // Bad
```
* Do place spaces around binary and ternary operators.
```
y = m * x + b; // Good
y=m*x+b;       // Bad
f(a, b);       // Good
f(a,b);        // Bad
c = a | b;     // Good
c = a|b;       // Bad
return condition ? 1 : 0; // Good
return condition ? 1:0;   // Bad
```
* Place spaces around the colon in a range-based for loop.
```
for (auto& plugin : plugins) // Good
for (auto& plugin: plugins)  // Bad
```
* Each statement should get its own line, so avoid multiple statements on one line.
```
x++; // Good
y++; // Good
x++; y++; // Avoid

if (condition) // Good
    doIt();

if (condition) doIt(); // Avoid
```
* An else statement should not go on the same line as a preceding close brace if one is present.
Bad:  
```
if (condition) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```
Good:  
```
if (condition)
{
    /* ... */
}
else
{
    /* ... */
}
```
* An else if statement should be written as an if statement when the prior if concludes with a return statement.
Good:
```
if (condition) {
    return someValue;
}
if (condition) {
    return someOtherValue;
}
```
Bad:
```
if (condition)
{
    return someValue;
}
else if (condition)
{
    return someOtherValue;
}
```
* Function definitions: place each brace on its own line. Other braces: place the open brace on a new line; place the close brace on its own line.
Bad:
```
int main() {
    /* ... */
}

class MyClass {
    /* ... */
};

namespace webcore {
    /* ... */
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    /* ... */
}
```
Good:
```
int main()
{
    /* ... */
}

class MyClass 
{
    /* ... */
};

namespace webcore
{
    /* ... */
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
    /* ... */
}
```
* One-line control clauses should use braces (simplifies further editing and prevents bugs).
```
if (condition)
{
    doIt();
}
``` 
## Const Accessors
Be careful about your accessors. Always provide the const version, the non-const version is optional. Return by value should be avoided as you will copy the content of your object.
```
inline int count() const { return count_; } // Ok, int is small type
inline MyType getData() { return m_data; } // Bad, m_data is big struct
inline MyType const & MyClass::getMyType() const { return mMyType; } // Ok, uses reference
```
## Singleton pattern  
Use a static member function named “instance()” to access the instance of the singleton.  
```
class MySingleton {
public:
    static MySingleton& instance();
```

## Operators
The binary operators = (assignment), [] (array subscription), -> (member access), as well as the n-ary () (function call) operator, must always be implemented as member functions, because the syntax of the language requires them to. Other operators can be implemented either as members or as non-members.For all operators where you have to choose to either implement them as a member function or a non-member function, use the following [rules of thumb to decide](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4421729) where possible:  
    * If it is a unary operator, implement it as a member function.
    * If a binary operator treats both operands equally (it leaves them unchanged), implement this operator as a non-member function.
    * If a binary operator does not treat both of its operands equally (usually it will change its left operand), it might be useful to make it a member function of its left operand’s type, if it has to access the operand's private parts.
Also dont forget about ["self assignment"](http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/assign.html):
```
MyClass& MyClass::operator=(const MyClass& other)  // copy assignment 
{
    if (this != &other) // <-- self assignment check
    {
        // copy some stuff
    }

    return *this;
}
```
## Don't shadow variables
Avoid things like this->x = x;
Don't give variables the same name as functions declared in your class

## Copy and assignment ctor/operator
Always declare a copy constructor and assignment operator when not using the trivial one
Many classes shouldn't be copied or assigned. If you're writing one of these, the way to enforce your policy is to declare a deleted copy constructor as private and not supply a definition. While you're at it, do the same for the assignment operator used for assignment of objects of the same class:
```
class Foo
{
  /* ... */
private:
    Foo(const Foo& x) = delete;
    Foo& operator=(const Foo& x) = delete;
};
```
Any code that implicitly calls the copy constructor will hit a compile-time error. That way nothing happens in the dark. When a user's code won't compile, they'll see that they were passing by value, when they meant to pass by reference (oops).

## STL inculdes
* Prefer Use C++ includes, not C includes where possible.
```
#include <cstdio> // Instead of #include <stdio.h>
#include <cstring> // Instead of #include <string.h>
```
* Prefer <library> to "library.h" for STL and library headers.
* Prefer unique_ptr instead of shared_ptr where possible. Unique pointers are way more lightweight than shared one. 
* For COM objects like Direct3D objects, you should use the smartpointer like "Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr" instead of std smartpointers like "std::unique_ptr".
* Use smartpointers judiciously, prefer raw pointers over smartpointers in most cases. Remember that passing variables by reference was enough in most places. Non-library code should, however, generally prefer smart pointers over raw.
* Avoid std::auto_ptr (its copy semantic is screwed).
* Smartpointer overhead:
std::unique_ptr (cannot be copied, can be moved) / std::scoped_ptr (cannot be copied or moved): Has memory overhead only if you provide it with some non-trivial deleter. Has time overhead only during constructor (if it has to copy the provided deleter) and during destructor (to destroy the owned object).
std::shared_ptr (can be copied): Has memory overhead for reference counter, though it is very small. Has time overhead in constructor (to create the reference counter), in destructor (to decrement the reference counter and possibly destroy the object) and in assignment operator (to increment the reference counter).

## Binary and Source Compatibility
* Definitions: 
    * 4.0.0 is a major release, 4.1.0 is a minor release, 4.1.1 is a patch release
    * Backward ↓ binary compatibility: Code linked to an earlier version of the library keeps working 
    * Forward ↑ binary compatibility: Code linked to a newer version of the library works with an older library
    * Source code compatibility: Code compiles without modification
* Keep backward ↓ binary compatibility + backward ↓ source code compatibility in minor releases
* Keep backward and forward binary compatibility + forward and backward source code compatibility in patch releases
    * Don't add/remove any public API (e.g. global functions, public/protected/private methods)
    * Don't reimplement methods (not even inlines, nor protected/private methods)
* Info on binary compatibility: [https://community.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C++](https://community.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C%2B%2B)
